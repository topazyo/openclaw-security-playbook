# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to this repository.

## Workflow

1. Open an issue describing the problem and scope.
2. Create focused changes tied to a single debt item or finding.
3. Run local validation relevant to changed files.
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - linked debt/finding ID
   - summary of changes
   - verification evidence

## Quality Expectations

- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
- Preserve security defaults and policy intent.
- Update docs when behavior or procedures change.

## Security-Sensitive Changes

For changes affecting security posture, policy semantics, or detection contracts, include explicit rationale and verification notes.
